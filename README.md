# Zepto E-Commerce-Inventory-Pricing-Analysis-Using-SQL
This is a complete, real-world data analyst portfolio project based on an e-commerce inventory dataset scraped from Zepto — one of India’s fastest-growing quick-commerce startups. This project simulates real analyst workflows, from raw data exploration to business-focused data analysis.
This project analyzes inventory and pricing data from a grocery delivery platform (Zepto). The dataset contains product-level information such as category, price (MRP), discount %, available stock, and stock status.

The goal is to identify key business problems (like stockouts, over-discounting, and inventory mismatch) and define KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) that can help optimize operations, improve margins, and enhance customer satisfaction.
Problem Statement

In quick-commerce grocery delivery businesses like Zepto, success depends on efficient inventory management and competitive pricing strategies.

Stockouts lead to lost sales and unhappy customers.

Overstocking leads to wastage (especially perishables).

High discounts may increase sales but can erode margins.

Thus, it is critical to analyze data to track inventory health, pricing impact, and customer service levels.

Business Problems Identified

Stock Management Issues

Several products have very low available stock, risking stockouts.

If demand is high and stock is low, customer churn is likely.

Pricing & Discounting Problems

High discount percentages (14–16% on essentials) may hurt margins.

Lack of cost price data → unable to confirm profitability.

Inventory Holding Risks

Products with high stock but low demand tie up working capital.

Perishable categories (like vegetables) face spoilage risks.

Customer Dissatisfaction

Frequent “Out of Stock” messages for daily essentials (like onions, tomatoes) → negative brand perception.

Demand-Supply Mismatch

Some fast-moving items have insufficient stock.
